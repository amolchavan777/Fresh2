Q2.3: Has automation reduced the overall testing effort? If so, by what percentage? How do you measure this reduction?

3. Quality Improvement

This section explores how automation contributes to improving software quality.





Q3.1: How do you measure the effectiveness of your automated tests in improving software quality? What metrics or KPIs do you use?



Q3.2: Have you observed a reduction in post-release defects since implementing automation? If yes, by what percentage? Please provide data if available.



Q3.3: Do you have specific metrics or KPIs related to test automation and quality? If so, what are they, and how are they tracked?

4. Adoption Rate

This section evaluates the extent of adoption and engagement with test automation among team members.





Q4.1: What percentage of your testing team is actively involved in writing and maintaining automated tests?



Q4.2: Are there any barriers to wider adoption of test automation within your team? If so, what are they, and how are you addressing them?



Q4.3: How do you train and upskill your team members in test automation? What resources or programs are available?

5. Tools and Technologies

This section focuses on the tools and frameworks used for test automation.





Q5.1: What test automation frameworks and tools are you currently using (e.g., Selenium, Appium, JUnit, Cypress)?



Q5.2: Are these tools integrated with your CI/CD pipeline? If yes, how? If not, what are the reasons for the lack of integration?



Q5.3: Do you face any limitations with your current tools? If so, what are they, and how do you plan to address them?

6. Challenges

This section identifies the key obstacles hindering progress in test automation.





Q6.1: What are the top three challenges you face in your test automation efforts? Please describe each briefly.



Q6.2: How do you address flaky tests or maintenance issues in your automated test suite?



Q6.3: Is there resistance from any stakeholders (e.g., developers, business units) towards test automation? If so, how do you manage it?

7. Future Plans

This section explores the strategic direction and goals for advancing test automation.





Q7.1: What are your goals for test automation in the next 12-24 months? Please outline specific objectives.



Q7.2: Do you have a roadmap for increasing automation coverage or improving the maturity of your automation processes? If yes, please share key milestones.



Q7.3: Are there any new tools, technologies, or methodologies you plan to adopt for test automation? If so, what are they, and why?

8. Additional Insights

This section allows teams to share qualitative experiences and learnings.





Q8.1: Can you share a success story where test automation significantly benefited your project? What were the key outcomes?



Q8.2: What lessons have you learned from your test automation journey that you would like to share with other teams?



Q8.3: If you could change one thing about your current test automation setup, what would it be, and why?

9. Organizational Context

This section helps understand the broader organizational context and allows for comparison across teams.





Q9.1: Are there differences in test automation maturity between different teams or projects within your organization? If so, what are they?



Q9.2: Do you share best practices or lessons learned from test automation across teams? If yes, how?



Q9.3: Is there a center of excellence or a community of practice for test automation in your organization? If not, do you plan to establish one?
